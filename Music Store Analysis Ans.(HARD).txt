1. Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent.

WITH best_selling_artist AS (
	SELECT artist.artist_id AS artist_id, artist.name AS artist_name,
	SUM(invoice_line.unit_price*invoice_line.quantity) AS total_spent_by_cx
	FROM invoice_line
	JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
	JOIN album ON album.album_id = track.album_id
	JOIN artist ON artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 3 DESC
	LIMIT  1
	)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, bsa.artist_name, 
SUM(il.unit_price * il.quantity) AS total_spent_by_cx
FROM customer c
JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
JOIN invoice_line il ON il.invoice_id = i.invoice_id
JOIN track t ON t.track_id = il.track_id
JOIN album alb ON alb.album_id = t.album_id
JOIN best_selling_artist bsa ON bsa.artist_id = alb.artist_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
ORDER BY 5 DESC

2. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country.We determine the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. 
Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.

WITH popular_genre AS (
SELECT customer.country, genre.name, genre.genre_id, Count(invoice_line.invoice_line_id) AS purchases,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer.country ORDER BY COUNT (invoice_line.invoice_line_id)DESC) AS row_no
FROM invoice_line 
JOIN invoice ON invoice_line.invoice_id = invoice.invoice_id
JOIN customer ON invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
JOIN genre ON track.genre_id = genre.genre_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 4 DESC
)
SELECT * FROM popular_genre WHERE row_no<=1

3. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country.
Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and howmuch they spent. 
For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.

WITH customerxcountry AS
(
	SELECT customer.customer_id, customer.first_name, customer.last_name, invoice.billing_country,
    SUM (total) AS total_spending,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY invoice.billing_country ORDER BY SUM (total) DESC) AS row_no
    FROM invoice
    JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
    GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
    ORDER BY 5 DESC, 4 ASC
)
SELECT * FROM customerxcountry WHERE row_no<=1;
