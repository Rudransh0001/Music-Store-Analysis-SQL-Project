1. Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music 
listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.

SELECT DISTINCT email, first_name, last_name
FROM customer
JOIN "invoice" ON invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
JOIN "invoice_line" ON invoice_line.invoice_id = invoice.invoice_id
WHERE "track_id" IN (
	SELECT "track_id" FROM track
	JOIN "genre" ON track.genre_id = genre.genre_id
	WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
)
ORDER BY email;

----WE CAN ALSO DO THIS VIA THIS METHOD----

SELECT DISTINCT email, first_name, last_name
FROM customer
JOIN "invoice" ON invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
JOIN "invoice_line" ON invoice_line.invoice_id = invoice.invoice_id
JOIN "track" ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
JOIN "genre" ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
ORDER BY email;

2. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a 
query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.

SELECT artist.name, artist.artist_id, count(artist.artist_id) AS "no_of_songs"
FROM artist
JOIN "album" ON album.artist_id = artist.artist_id
JOIN "track" ON track.album_id = album.album_id
JOIN "genre" ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
GROUP BY artist.artist_id
ORDER BY no_of_songs DESC
LIMIT 10;

3. Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length.Return the Name 
and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first.

--STEP1--
SELECT AVG(milliseconds) FROM track
--STEP2--
SELECT "name", "milliseconds"
FROM track
WHERE milliseconds > (
SELECT AVG(milliseconds) FROM track 
)
ORDER BY milliseconds DESC;
